						<li>You can make "structures" by choosing a shape, color and orientation for 4 pieces in a 2 by 2. (yea, flat, I know, but I want to actually implement it)
					* The mod will tell if it follows the rule or not.
					* The defuser can make a guess, by drilling down all possible rules, using a couple of buttons. The buttons change caption along the way. Maybe the first stage they will read "color" / "shape" / "relative position" / "absolute position". Then if you click "color" the captions will change to "all same", "exactly 1", "more than 2". Then if you pick "exactly 1" the captions become "yellow", "red", "blue". Etc.
					* You can only make a guess if you have guessing tokens. Tokens can be earned by solving other modules. (give away some if there are too few other mods, maybe also after some time)
					* You cannot strike. It will just cost tokens/time to guess.
					* If you guess wrong, the mod will offer you a structure that disproves your guess.
